# Unit 2 Creative Computing
<h2>A guide through creative computing by a beginner for a beginner </h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am a student of graphic communication design at Central Saint Martins. I do not have much knowledge when it comes to creative computing, electronics and coding. This Unit I started is a chance for me to learn what it means, new skills and ultimatley share it with others. I am planning on writing things in a way that myself and others as well that do not have much knowledge about this topic are able to understand it. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I decided to pursue this project because...</p>
<strong>What is Physical Computing?</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Physical computing are interactive systems such as hardware, software and materials which combined together are able to sense and respond to the world around them. It collects information about the environment and the real world and acts back by making a decision. Computers are literally everywhere. It allows you to see to see how physical devices can be monitored and controlled by a microprocessor. Creating or using devices that that interact with the world around them. It senses the information, reflects about it and then acts. An example is a self driving car. It uses sensors, analyzes data and acts.Through physical computing, you can develop digital solutions that directly impact the real world based on real-world needs. </p>
<strong>What is Arduino? </strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Arduino is a programmable device that can be used to allow our code to interact with the world around us. It is made of multiple components and sesnors. It senses the world around it, and based on its programming it reacts accordingly. Temperature sensor is an example. It measures the temperature of the room. If for example it finds that the temperatuire is above 19 degress celcius, it applies this value to the program that is coded with. If it sees that the temperature is less than 20, a light LED turns on. If not it turns off. You have to communicate wtih your device and programm how it should sense, what it should think and how it should react. </p>
<strong>How does Arduino work? </strong>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let's have a look at what Arduino actually is and how it works. I'll then demostrate defferent examples of what you can do with it as a begginer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Arduino kit offers different components to create your circuit. There is the Arduino software which makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board. Inside the kit you find:</p>
<ul><p>1. Arduino Uno, which is the most important part of the kit. </p>
<ul><p>2.The Breadboard, is the tool to experiment with circuits and you can make quick electrical connections. Components are plugged into the holes.</p> 
<ul><p>3.LEDs come in different colours. It has a longer and a shorter leg. Usually the longer is positive while the shorter leg is negative.</p>
<ul><p>4.The USB Cable, connects to your Arduino as well to your computer. It provides power to the unit and the cable transmits the data from the computer's software to the Arduino.</p>
</ul><p>5.The resistors, can look different depenidng on the kit you have. They give and limit the flow of current to other components.</p>
</ul><p>6.The Pushbuttons, are buttons that when pressed they can interupt or make the flow of electricty go. When the button is pushed all the four legs are going to be connected.</p>
</ul><p>7.The Jumper Wires, are for making connections on the breadboard, as well to connect breadboard and Arduino itself. They come in different colors which does not change anything, it is simply to organize them better when together.</p>
<nav> Before jumping into realizing an actual circut with the components, I am going to explain further what the breadboard is and how it works to better understand the process.<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;">In order to build a circuit, you have to connect circuit elements together. The schematic above is going to be built in the real world. The holes along the columns are connected together. If you bring a leg of the LED and the resistor, they will then be connected together. Except across the dividing layers between the holes. The positive and negative rows are not connected together, they are connected on their own row only. You have to put elements in the same column, not row, to make them connected. </p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now I will show through images one of the process to turn on through the circuit the LED light on.</span> <br/>

<p style="text-align: center;">Take an Arduino Uno R3 and a small Breadboard.</p>
<img width="389" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 23 37 47" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139288829-4ed65fdd-7c8e-41a5-866d-b4d3d7583385.png">
<p style="text-align: center;">You need now to connect a jumper wire to the board. You connect from the SV to the first positive hole of the breadboard. This will give this entire vertical line power. </p>
<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 23 46 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139288981-1f878a6e-4318-4ba2-9b10-9db1da893f8b.png"> 
  <p style="text-align: center;">Now you position the Pushbutton more or less where it is placed in the image above. Make sure to push well the button down so it clicks.</p>
  <img width="378" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 23 48 49" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139289084-8cb7df99-8fde-4460-86c0-2985144615b2.png">
  <p style="text-align: center;">You now place the resistor on the breadboard. To do so make sure to bend the legs of it. You will place one of the legs in the hole next to the Pushbutton's top left leg. You will place the other leg on the other column, on the negative side and either one up or down hole from the other leg.</p>
<img width="382" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 23 53 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139289195-3796b478-ef84-4b97-b4d9-6b14ab915bcb.png">
 <p style="text-align: center;">You will place the LED light on the same vertical side of the Pushbutton's legs. The long leg needs to go to the positive voltage. </p>
  <img width="382" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 23 56 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139289349-d5c91244-20b1-481d-add6-687ebcacc3c9.png">
<p style="text-align: center;">You will place a new jumper wire. One will fill the hole which is on the same horizontal line of the LED light and the one right next to it. The other will be the hole on the positive, same horizontal line.</p>
<img width="382" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 00 00 38" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139289437-debb6e03-7aab-47e0-8b49-6e4e12c241e7.png"> 
  <p style="text-align: center;">You will put in a new jumper wire. One will fill the hole in front of the LED light on the vertical line compared to the Pushbutton. The other will be connected on the horizontal line of the Pushbutton bottom left leg, right next to it. </p>
  <img width="364" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 00 06 52" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139289551-14a03a59-4221-4049-bdee-0c3b41b2708c.png">
  <p style="text-align: center;">You will connect it with a USB cable that is connected on the other hand to the computer. You can now press the button and the LED light will turn on. </p>
 <h3>I want to write some personal feesback about the journey it took me to understand how this initial process works.</h3>
  <em>At first it was really hard for me to even simply conceptualizing what all of these informations meant to me. I had initially no idea what physical computing was and honestly it sounded very scary. I am still very afraid of how this entire world works as the way of thinking might appear so different from my personal perspective. I was very frustrated at the beggining when I was trying to build the circuit as it was not working. After litterally ten different tries, I was able to make the LED light work and it was so satisfying! It was almost magical and just very rewarding. I suggest following very well another person's tutorial and if it does not work just carefully move around the components, until you make it work. I was then motivated to try other circuits and I am going to show a couple more I tried.</em>
<h4>Second Circuit Example</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">For this next part you need to download Arduino's software. The one I downloaded is Arduino 1. 8. 9. This will open the Arduino program. Every Arduino program has a "void setup" and a "void loop". You need to go to "Tools", then click "Port" and then make sure that it is on "Arduino Uno" option. You also need to click "Board" to make sure it matches as well "Arduino Uno". With the pins you can connect things with them and create circuits. For example, if you are working with pin 13, you will write in the program "pinMode(13,OUTPUT)". When you write words in the correct form, they should turn into a color. When you want the LED light to turn on, you write "digitalWrite(13,HIGH)". When you write "LOW" instead, it will turn it off. To make the light blink you then add "digitalWrite(13,LOW);" and you need to add a delay to make sure the blinking is visible to the human eye. The command is "delay(1000);" in between the two other commands and after the "digitalWrite(13,LOW)".</p>
  <img width="250" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 10 59 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93208364/139292084-24d718a1-19ac-4d88-8bfc-338886d233a8.png">
 <br>
<p style="text-align: center;">You will place a wire in pin 13 and connect to a column. Then you connect a leg of a resistor by placing a leg in the same column of the wire. You will place the LED light connected to the second leg of the resistor, this means it must be on the same column. The long leg needs to go towards the positive voltage. The last wire will pin GND and connect on the same column of the LED light's second leg. This is the program used to make the light turn on. The delay is very long in order to see it well. But you can change it however you please. </p>

<br>
<h4>Third Circuit Example</h4>  
<p style="text-align: center;">For this part, you will need an arduino Uno, a breadboard, a USB cable, 3 resistors and 4 jumper wires. Connect them like in the pictures above. The resistors need to be spaced out from each other and a leg be on the negative row. The LEDs longest leg will connect with the resistor's leg. The wires must connect on one side with the other LEDs leg and the other on the pins. The USB cable will power the Arduino. Below is the program used to make the lights go on a sequence. The loop is the actual instructions of the lights to follow.
